            <div class="content content-2">
                <p>Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, has outlined the company's 2024 goals, focusing on AI, consumer platforms like Android, and enterprise solutions. The seven objectives include delivering advanced AI, enhancing productivity, creating helpful personal computing platforms, fostering innovation on Google Cloud, ensuring trust in products, building an extraordinary work environment, and improving company efficiency. Other key points include the imminent launch of Gemini Ultra and ongoing AI development.</p>

            <div class="content content-2">
                <p>Google continues to cut “non-priority” jobs to pool more funds for their growing AI platform Alphabet. This aligns with the goals of the company as they have seen great success at the end of 2023 while cutting almost 8000 jobs from the company with the latest cuts coming primarily from the YouTube advertisement division. It’s hard to say what is morally right in this situation. While Google and Mr. Pichai are doing their part as a business to create more wealth, it comes at the cost of the livelihood of so many homes.</p>

            <div class="content content-2">
                <p>Sundar Pichai continues to push Google towards the A.I route. Google has officially announced the introduction of subscription plans for Bard Advance, its advanced chatbot, during the fourth-quarter earnings call. The decision aims to meet the growing demand for premium AI services. Bard Advance, currently free, is expected to offer a more sophisticated experience, leveraging Gemini Ultra's capabilities in text, images, audio, video, and code processing. This strategic move aligns with Google's broader vision of monetizing advanced AI capabilities and providing users with a feature-rich conversational AI experience.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content content-2">
                <p>Mr. Pichai is accused of not creating a good source of morale for his company. He uses quotes such as “Sometimes we have a complicated, duplicative structure” to justify laying people off. This shows that Sundar Pichai does not treat each individual as an end in themself but rather as a means to a more “efficient” company. He can live with this by believing that to reach ambitious goals, he has to be a leader who has to make a tough decision. What kind of legacy will be left for Mr. Pichai when we look at this point in the future and see the over 12000 affected homes from the job cuts?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content content-2">
                <p>Mr. Pichai has plans on further cutting the workforce of Google even after having cuts been made. These cuts will not be affecting every team in the company and have mainly accumulated to about 6 percent of what it was in the beginning for 2023. 4 out of 10 of these jobs are because of advancements being made in AI. As a research and development company, AI is proving to be a real tool that is capable of removing entire swathes of jobs over the years. If Google is doing this to create more applications of AI then let’s hope there are new applications that can be used to create jobs for the ones it replaced.</p>

                <p>Google’s Sundar Pichai announced that they had reached 100 million total subscribers to their free services like Google Drive and Photos. Alongside this news, they announced that they would be putting up new pay barriers and creating new AI-assisted services that could be utilized for an increased price to their current subscription-based services. Now that Google has the client base they don’t mind transitioning to a more paid service. Google has long stood as a giant when it comes to free material provided but now the conglomerate has decided to claim what they set out to do with their new game plan, make as much money as they can while cutting costs at the same time.</p>
